# Trafi-UI-Remake
### This UI/UX Analysis is done by self experience and survey.

## Main Changes
1. As people usually type the place they want to go, it's better to move *Get me somewhere* button with *Set home and work address* in the top of the card.

2. Most people confused or unsure if the address they type in the app is precise or not, so after they type the destination the map will sho with all possible route in a floating card.

3. This is the most frustating and tiring part to scroll indefinitely where people want to find the specific name of a mode of transportation such as bus name in a long list of bus name. So the change is every option will have a toogle button to be expanded or collapsed to make the user faster to find it
